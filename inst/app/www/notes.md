## Notes

Something about data sources/accuracy etc. Discussion on how data has
been processed/weighted/re-scaled, etc. Publicly available vs more
sensitive data.

From meeting notes, maybe there is a desire for users to “save” inputs
from a session? And/or download a type of report/share with
collaborators? Would be good to think about this aspect of the user
experience as well
