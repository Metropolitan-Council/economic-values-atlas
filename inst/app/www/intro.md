# Welcome to the Economic Values Atlas

Brookings Institution pioneered an Economic Values Atlas in 2019 for the
Portland Metro region

## What this tool does

The Economic Value Atlas is a tool to help policymakers focus
investments in ways that will create access to family-wage jobs and
support growing industries.

<br> The tool will help verify and improve our understanding of the
economy by providing an interactive, visual display of variables that
tie back to a set of desired economic outcomes. It will also help
provide a more transparent public discussion about economic conditions
among the communities in the region and how we can build an inclusive
economy and expand access to opportunity.

<br>

## Why we built the tool

Our dedication to creating a great quality of life has brought an influx
of new residents and rapid job growth, creating challenges for the
region’s livability, including wage disparities, fewer affordable
housing options and longer travel times.

<br> The tool will help to share resources and information at a scale
that crosses city and county lines, which will help our region build and
leverage distinct competitive advantages for communities and industries.
This tool helps us better understand where businesses are growing, what
they need, how people get there and how products get to market.
