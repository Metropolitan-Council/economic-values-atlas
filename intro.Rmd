# Welcome to the Economic Values Atlas

Brookings Institution pioneered an Economic Values Atlas in 2019 for the Portland Metro region (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/announcing-the-economic-value-atlas-a-new-approach-to-regional-transportation-and-land-use-planning/" target="_blank">Tomer et al.</a>). Please scroll down to start using this tool. We suggest you use a desktop web browser for the best experience.

## What this tool does 

The Economic Value Atlas is a tool to help policymakers focus investments in ways that will create access to family-wage jobs and support growing industries.

<br>
The tool will help verify and improve our understanding of the economy by providing an interactive, visual display of variables that tie back to a set of desired economic outcomes. It will also help provide a more transparent public discussion about economic conditions among the communities in the region and how we can build an inclusive economy and expand access to opportunity.

<br>

## Why we built the tool
Our dedication to creating a great quality of life has brought an influx of new residents and rapid job growth, creating challenges for the regionâ€™s livability, including wage disparities, fewer affordable housing options and longer travel times.

<br>
The tool will help to share resources and information at a scale that crosses city and county lines, which will help our region build and leverage distinct competitive advantages for communities and industries. This tool helps us better understand where businesses are growing, what they need, how people get there and how products get to market.
