# Welcome to the Economic Values Atlas

Brookings Institution pioneered an Economic Values Atlas in 2019 for the Portland Metro region (<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/announcing-the-economic-value-atlas-a-new-approach-to-regional-transportation-and-land-use-planning/" target="_blank">Tomer et al.</a>). This is an implementation of the concept for our region. Please scroll down to start using this tool. We suggest you use a desktop web browser for the best experience.

## What this tool does 

This interactive tool explores the economic values of our region. The economic values are specific to our region and are shaped by our 30-year regional plan. We seek to promote sustainable infrastructure development, a resilient economy, and shared prosperity throughout our region.

<br>
We have synthesized existing and complex data sources to produce accessible conclusions. This tool allows users to find "opportunity zones" where economic investments jointly: a) have the potential for disproportionately positive impacts for the future prosperity of our entire region, and b) are poised for success with favorable infrastructure and accessibility to underutilized workforces.

## Why we built the tool
This project is motivated by the fact that our region shares a common goal for economic development (as outlined in Thrive 2040 and predecessors), and yet divergent outcomes for economic prosperity exist across our region. Developing and leveraging this Economic Values Atlas with a shared language for economic development is one proposed intervention. EVA can bring an objective lens to project evaluation and decision-making processes that guide regional economic investments, re-investments, and development.

<br>
The need for an Economic Values Atlas was underscored by events transpiring during the year 2020. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted and destabilized local and global economies. The prevalence of police brutality, racism, and systemic inequities impacting communities of color was more widely recognized. These events punctuate the need for more granular and holistic measures of economic prosperity and opportunity. Building a jointly prosperous, resilient, and equitable economic future for our region necessitates new thinking.
