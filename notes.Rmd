## Notes

Something about data sources/accuracy etc. Discussion on how data has been processed/weighted/re-scaled, etc. Publicly available vs more sensitive data. 

From meeting notes, maybe there is a desire for users to "save" inputs from a session? And/or download a type of report/share with collaborators? Would be good to think about this aspect of the user experience as well
